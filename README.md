# Spigot.AntiExplosions
A small simple plugin that disables explosions in minecraft.

###### A Small Note
This plugin only disables the explosion component of events that cause explosions. As such hugging Creepers, TNT, or Withers will still cause damage and effects, but not actually harm the environment. I may add configuration options to this later so people can select which explosions to disable, but as it stands that is not on the table for now.

###### Explosions Confirmed Blocked
This plugin has been confirmed to block Creeper, Ghast, TNT, and Wither explosions while still keeping their damage, all of these mobs I summoned on my head on my Vanilla survival world. If you find any other explosion sources, or ones that are not blocked please let me know.
